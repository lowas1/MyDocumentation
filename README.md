Geology Mine Game
=================

Link to README on my Github: ()[https://github.com/lowas1/MineGame/blob/main/README.md]

This Geology Mining Game is a great way to study minerals and rocks from the  
three main rock groups: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. But this game    
is not only educational, it is also very fun! The player takes on the role of   
a miner and gets to chose where they want to mine. After they chose a site,   
they can begin mining for gems. A player wins by finding all the hidden gems   
in their respective mines. Good luck!
